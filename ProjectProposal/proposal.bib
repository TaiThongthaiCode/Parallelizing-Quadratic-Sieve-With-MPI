% this is an example bibtex file, there are different types of entries
% each with different format requirements
% the most commonly used are book, inproceedings, article, and misc
% annotate is used to add comments about the work to the .bib file
% entries (its contents will not show up in the References section)
% see http://www.bibtex.org/ for lots more information


% not every field of each style of entry is required, but author, title,
% year, and some specification of how it is published is required for
% most formats  (I could remove month here, for example)
% anything I put in { } will be translated as is (this is how I can
% force capitaliziation), anything in "" will be capitalize based on
% the whim of bibtex
